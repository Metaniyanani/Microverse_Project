           </header>
           <p>
C++ is a general purpose programming
					language and widely used now a days '
					for competitive programming. It has
					imperative, object-oriented and generic
					programming features. <br><br>
          C++ runs on lots of
					platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
					C++ is an efficient
					and powerful language and finds wide use
					in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
					real-time simulations. Because of the
					inclusion of rich function libraries,
					working in C++ becomes simpler and
					convenient than C. <br><br>
          Being object-oriented
					programming like Java, C++ provides
					the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
					encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
					exception handling and function overloading.

           Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name
					suggests uses objects in programming.
					Object-oriented programming aims to
					implement real-world entities like
					inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,
					etc in programming. <br><br>
          The main
					aim of OOP is to bind together the data
					and the functions that operate on them
					so that no other part of the code can
					access this data except that function.

           <h2>Inheritance</h2>
           </header>
           <p>
            The capability of a class to derive
					properties and characteristics from
					another class is called Inheritance.
					Inheritance is one of the most important
					feature of Object Oriented Programming.
					Sub Class: The class that inherits
					properties from another class
					is called Sub class or Derived Class.<br><br>
					Super Class: The class whose properties
					are inherited by sub class is called Base
					Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we
					have to write the functions only one time
					instead of three times as we
					have inherited rest of the three classes
					from base class(Vehicle).

           <h2>
            Polymorphism
           </h2>
           <p>
            The word polymorphism means having many
					forms. In simple words, we can define
					polymorphism as the ability of a message
					to be displayed in more than one form.
					A real-life example of polymorphism, a
					person at the same time can have
					different characteristics.<br><br>
					Like a man at the same time is a father,
					a husband, an employee. So the same
					person posses different behavior in
					different situations. This is called
					polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
					as one of the important features of Object
					Oriented Programming.

               <h2>Abstraction</h2>
               </header>
               <p>
               Data abstraction is one of the most
					essential and important feature of object
					oriented programming in C++. Abstraction
					means displaying only essential information
					and hiding the details. Data abstraction
					refers to providing only essential information
					about the data to the outside world,
					hiding the background details or implementation.
				<br>	<br> Consider a real life example of a man driving
					a car. The man only knows that pressing the
					accelerators will increase the speed of car
					or applying brakes will stop the car but he
					does not know about how on pressing accelerator
					the speed is actually increasing, he does
					not know about the inner mechanism of the car
					or the implementation of accelerator, brakes
					etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.

                   Encapsulation
                 </h2>
                 </header>
                <p>
                In normal terms Encapsulation is defined
					as wrapping up of data and information
					under a single unit. In Object Oriented
					Programming, Encapsulation is defined as
					binding together the data and the functions
					that manipulates them. Consider
					a real life example
					of encapsulation, in a company there are
					different sections like the accounts section,
					finance section, sales section etc. The finance
					section handles all the financial transactions
					and keep records of all the data related to
					finance.
